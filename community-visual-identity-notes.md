# Community Visual Identity Notes for Base

Base already communicates openness and clarity. That’s why builders gravitate toward it — it feels practical, not ornamental.

Here are a few small thoughts from a contributor’s perspective:

## 1) Consistency over novelty
Community assets work best when they reuse the core shapes and Base blue rather than inventing new marks. Consistency makes recognition instant, even in crowded feeds.

## 2) Legibility first
Many community posts compress images for speed. A simple rule like “minimum text size” or “safe margins” would keep visuals readable without policing creativity.

## 3) Real examples help
Including a tiny gallery of community-made visuals (with credit) would guide newcomers better than a long ruleset. People copy good patterns when they can see them.

## 4) Tone of voice
Clear > clever. The best Base posts feel welcoming and straight to the point. That tone makes technical work less intimidating for first-time builders.

**Why this matters**  
A decentralized brand becomes strong when many people make it coherent. Small suggestions like these keep the ecosystem recognizable while leaving room for personal style.

> A clean signal travels farther. Base should look as open as it feels.
