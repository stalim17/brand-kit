# Community Style Guide for Base Builders

A consistent visual language helps communicate what Base stands for — openness, clarity, and collaboration.  
Here are a few thoughts on how the brand could stay recognizable while evolving through community creativity.

### Visual Principles
- **Openness:** Use clear spacing, light backgrounds, and avoid clutter.  
- **Energy:** Integrate Base blue with neutral tones — keep it bright, not aggressive.  
- **Consistency:** Reuse the Base logo elements rather than recreating variations.

### Content Tone
Keep the voice friendly but precise. Builders communicate not to impress but to connect.  
It’s fine to sound human — Base culture is about inclusion, not formality.

### Why this matters
A decentralized brand thrives on community participation.  
When hundreds of builders keep visual consistency, it reinforces trust and belonging.

> A clean brand makes a strong signal.  
> Base is not just a chain — it’s a culture of clarity. ⚡
